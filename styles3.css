/**
 * By the way, you can edit this box. Try adding new CSS!
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * The property 'text-shadow' takes the parameters:
 * 'x', 'y', 'blur', 'color'.
 *
 * So if I wanted to mirror the values,
 * I could place a shadow 15px under it,
 * with a little blur for effect:
 */

.value {
  text-shadow: 0px 15px 1px white;
}

/**
 * Try it out! There's lots you can do.
 * Try playing with text sizes, shadows, animations, or just
 * break the page. I won't hold it against you.
